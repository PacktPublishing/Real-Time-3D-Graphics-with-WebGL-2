**Build Interactive 3D Applications with JavaScript and WebGL 2 (OpenGL ES 3.0)**


## What Is This Book About?
As highly interactive applications have become an increasingly important part of the user experience, WebGL is a unique and cutting-edge technology that brings hardware-accelerated 3D graphics to the web.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the rendering pipeline provided in WebGL
* Build and render 3D objects with WebGL
* Develop lights using shaders, 3D math, and the physics of light reflection
* Create a camera and use it to navigate a 3D scene
* Use texturing, lighting, and shading techniques to render realistic 3D scenes

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
<html>
<head>
  <title>Real-Time 3D Graphics with WebGL 2</title>

  <style type="text/css">
    canvas {
      border: 5px dotted blue;
    }
  </style>
</head>

```

**Following Is What You Need for This Book:**
This book is intended for developers who are interested in building highly interactive 3D applications for the web. A basic understanding of JavaScript is necessary; no prior computer graphics or WebGL knowledge is required.

With the following software and hardware list, you can run all code files present in the book.


### Software and Hardware List

| Chapter  | Software required                              | OS required                        |
| -------- | -----------------------------------------------| -----------------------------------|
| All      | Firefox 51+ or Chrome 56+ or Android Chrome 64+| Supports multiple OS               |
| All      | Web server to serve local assets               | Supports multiple OS               |

We also provide a PDF file that has color images of the screenshots/diagrams used in this book. [Click here to download it](https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/9781788629690_ColorImages.pdf).


### Running Examples Locally
If you do not have a web server, we recommend you install a lightweight web server from the following options:

- Serve: https://github.com/zeit/serve
- Lighttpd: http://www.lighttpd.net
- Python Server: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server

To run the examples locally on your machine, run your server from the root of the directory, since the `common` directory is a shared dependency across chapters.

## Errata
* Page 447: **Babylon.js (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)** _should be_ **Babylon.js (https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js)**
